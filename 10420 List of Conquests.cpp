In Act I, Leporello is telling Donna Elvira about his master's long list of conquests: 

``This is the list of the beauties my master has loved, a list I've made out myself: take a look, read it with me. In Italy six hundred and forty, in Germany two hundred and thirty-one, a hundred in France, ninety-one in Turkey; but in Spain already a thousand and three! Among them are country girls, waiting-maids, city beauties; there are countesses, baronesses, marchionesses, princesses: women of every rank, of every size, of every age.'' (Madamina, il catalogo Ã¨ questo) 

As Leporello records all the ``beauties'' Don Giovanni ``loved'' in chronological order, it is very troublesome for him to present his master's conquest to others because he needs to count the number of ``beauties'' by their nationality each time. You are to help Leporello to count.
